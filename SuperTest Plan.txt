- Create a database specifically for running tests on.
This needs to be used during Continuous Testing. 
We need to write a npm script that will change the environment variables (db uri connection details) to use test environment variables

Updated Config with local env
Install cross-env
We want update our npm tests scripts to use env
Write the scripts that will be used in Continuous Testing
    Empty the database (to get rid of previous test remant data)
    Create the database tables again
    Populate the database tables

"scripts": {
    "start-dev": "nodemon index.js",
    "migrate": "npx sequelize-cli db:migrate",
    "migrate:reset": "npx sequelize-cli db:migrate:undo:all && npm run migrate",
     "test": "npm run db:reset && cross-env NODE_ENV=test jest --testTimeout=10000",
    "pretest": "cross-env NODE_ENV=test npm run migrate:reset"
}


Before Continuous Testing happens, we want to switch to using the testing database
This means setting up the testing database before we run tests
We will need to write DB scripts that
    Empty the database (to get rid of previous test remant data)
    Setup the database again
Only then should we run the tests
