Create a database specifically for running tests on.
This needs to be used during Continuous Testing. 
We need to write a npm script that will change the environment variables (db uri connection details) to use test environment variables

Before Continuous Testing happens, we want to switch to using the testing database
This means setting up the testing database before we run tests
We will need to write DB scripts that
    Empty the database (to get rid of previous test remant data)
    Setup the database again
Only then should we run the tests
